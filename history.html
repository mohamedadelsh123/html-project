          <p>Computer programming is essential in our world today, running the systems for almost every device we use. Computer programming languages allow us to tell machines what to do. Machines and humans “think” very differently, so programming languages are necessary to bridge that gap.</p>

          <p>The first computer programming language was created in 1883, when a woman named Ada Lovelace worked with Charles Babbage on his very early mechanical computer, the Analytical Engine. While Babbage was concerned with simply computing numbers, Lovelace saw that the numbers the computer worked with could represent something other than just amounts of things. She wrote an algorithm for the Analytical Engine that was the first of its kind. Because of her contribution, Lovelace is credited with creating the first computer programming language. As different needs have arisen and new devices have been created, many more languages have followed.</p>
          <p><b>1883</b>: <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/adalovelace/">Algorithm for the Analytical Engine</a>: Created by Ada Lovelace for Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine to compute <a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Bernoulli_numbers">Bernoulli numbers</a>, it’s considered to be the first computer programming language.</p>
          <p><b>1949</b>: <a href="https://faculty.orangecoastcollege.edu/sgilbert/lessons/ABriefHistoryOfProgramming/index.html">Assembly Language</a>: First widely used in the <a href="https://www.tnmoc.org/edsac?rq=Electronic%20Delay%20Storage%20Automatic%20Calculator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator</a>, assembly language is a type of low-level computer programming language that simplifies the language of machine code, the specific instructions needed to tell the computer what to do.</p>
          <p><b>1952</b>: Autocode: Autocode was a generic term for a family of early computer programming languages. The first was developed by Alick Glennie for the Mark 1 computer at the University of Manchester in the U.K. Some consider autocode to be the first compiled computer programming language, meaning that it can be translated directly into machine code using a program called a compiler.</p>
          <p><b>1957</b>: <a href="https://www.fortran.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortran</a>: A computer programming language created by John Backus for complicated scientific, mathematical, and statistical work, Fortran stands for<b> For</b>mula<b> Tran</b>slation. It is the one of the oldest computer programming languages still used today.</p>

Kurtz at Dartmouth College so that students who did not have a strong technical or mathematical understanding could still use computers, it stands for <b>B</b>eginner’s <b>A</b>ll-purpose <b>S</b>ymbolic <b>I</b>nstruction <b>C</b>ode. A modified version of BASIC was written by Bill Gates and Paul Allen. This was to become the first Microsoft product.</p>

          <p><b>1972</b>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smalltalk</a>: Developed by Alan Kay, Adele Goldberg, and Dan Ingalls at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, Smalltalk allowed computer programmers to modify code on the fly and also introduced other aspects now present in common computer programming languages including Python, Java, and Ruby.</p>
          <p><b>1972</b>: <a href="https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/docs/chistory.html">C</a>: Developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs, C is considered by many to be the first high-level language. A high-level computer programming language is closer to human language and more removed from the machine code. C was created so that an operating system called Unix could be used on many different types of computers. It has influenced many other languages, including Ruby, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, and Python.</p>
          <p><b>1972</b>: <a href="https://www.sqlcourse.com/intro.html">SQL</a>: SQL was developed by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce at IBM. SQL stands for <b>S</b>tructured <b>Q</b>uery <b>L</b>anguage. It is used for viewing and changing information that is stored in databases.

          <p><b>1990</b>: <a href="https://www.ossblog.org/haskell-programming-language-profile/">Haskell</a>: Named after Haskell Brooks Curry, an American logician and mathematician. Haskell is called a purely functional computer programming language, which basically means that it is mostly mathematical. It is used by many industries, especially those that deal with complicated calculations, records, and number-crunching.</p>
          <p><b>1991</b>: <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/">Python</a>: Designed by Guido Van Rossum, Python is easier to read and requires fewer lines of code than many other computer programming languages.

It is mostly used by statisticians and those performing different types of data analysis.</p>
          <p><b>1995</b>: Java: Originally called Oak, Java was developed by Sun Microsystems. It was intended for cable boxes and hand-held devices but was later enhanced so it could be used to deliver information on the World Wide Web. Java is everywhere, from computers to smartphones to parking meters. Three billion devices run Java!</p>
          <p><b>1995</b>: <a href="https://secure.php.net/docs.php">PHP</a>: Created by Rasmus Lerdorf, PHP is used mostly for Web development and is usually run on Web servers. It originally stood for <b>P</b>ersonal <b>H</b>ome <b>P</b>age, as it was used by Lerdorf to manage his own online information. PHP is now widely used to build websites and blogs. WordPress, a popular website creation tool, is written using PHP.</p>
          <p><b>1995</b>: <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/">Ruby</a>: Ruby was created by Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto, who combined parts of his favorite languages to form a new general-purpose computer programming language that can perform many programming tasks. It is popular in Web application development. Ruby code executes more slowly, but it allows for computer programmers to quickly put together and run a program.</p>
          <p><b>1995</b>: JavaScript: Created in just 10 days by Brendan Eich, this language is mostly used to enhance many Web browser interactions. Almost every major website uses Javascript.</p>

Since computer and technology use is much different today than it was when languages such as C++, Java, and Python were introduced and put to use, problems arose when huge computer systems became common. Go was intended to improve the working environment for programmers so they could write, read, and maintain large software systems more efficiently.</p>
